          symptoms: 'The spots are oval to diamond-shaped, up to 10 cm long, and at right angles to the length of the leaf. They are brown on the upper surface, zoned, with yellow margins, and grey to brown below. The spots often merge, covering large areas of the leaf; this occurs particularly at the margin of the leaf giving a band of dead tissue with a zigzag yellow border between diseased and healthy parts. Banana (Cordana) leaf spot infections often occurs on banana black cross leaf spots. This suggests that the fungus is a weak pathogen and needs a wound to infect. Spores are produced on the underside of the leaf in large numbers, making the spots appear greyish-brown and hairy. They are spread in wet, windy weather.',

          symptoms: 'The fungus invades bananas through the fine (hair) roots, travelling through the roots and stem in the xylem or water-conducting tissues. Spores are produced, and these and the growth of the fungus block the flow of water and cause a wilt. Another type of spore, a chlamydospore, is produced in the soil; this is thick walled and allows the fungus to survive when there is no host to infect. The first sign is a yellowing at the margins of older leaves, advancing towards the midrib. Leaves turn brown, dry, and eventually collapse. Disease symptoms move progressively from older to younger leaves until only a few of the youngest leaves remain green and erect, with the older ones forming a "skirt" around the stem. Eventually, all the leaves collapse. On some varieties the stems split. Internally, brown, red and yellow rings occur in the stem, at first at the centre and later, in cases of severe infection, spreading throughout the stem. Suckers may also show symptoms. Eventually, all parts above and below ground will die and rot. Fusarium wilt can remain alive in soil for long periods, perhaps indefinitely, as resistant spores, in infested plant debris or in the roots of other plants that are hosts. Spread of Fusarium wilt over short distances is by root-to-root contact in surface run-off water, in soil attached to vehicles, tools, footwear, and in unsterilIsed potting composts. Over longer distances, spread occurs both within and between countries in infected planting material.',

          symptoms: 'Symptoms vary depending on the strain of the virus, the variety of banana or plantain and the environment. The most common symptom is lines of yellow that run from the midrib of the leaf to the margin. These streaks are continuous or broken, and either scattered throughout the leaf or in bands. As the leaf ages, the streaks turn brown or black. Initially, the symptoms are similar to Cucumber mosaic virus.Infected plants may be smaller than normal and less vigorous, with smaller bunches. In some African countries, dieback and internal rotting of the pseudostem occurs. Differences between symptoms in different parts of the world led to them being described as distinct viruses. Molecular studies on the DNA of the viruses have confirmed the differences. Spread of the virus is in planting material, suckers primarily. Spread can also occur as plants in tissue culture if they are not tested properly. It is now known that the virus or parts of the virus can enter the DNA of certain varieties (e.g., AAB, ABB, AAAB types) and remain hidden there without showing symptoms. However, if bananas are grown under stress, such as occurs when they are growing as tissue cultures, the virus reassembles, multiplies, and symptoms appear. Spread between plants is by mealybugs, especially species of Planococcus and Pseudococcus, although how important they are is not well known.',

          treatment: 'Due to their small sizes and high rates of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. All predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and then prey extensively on eggs and larvae. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera are known to parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include aphid wasps, anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. For this reason, many growers are occasionally forced to make limited use of pesticides to control thrips populations in the field and in greenhouses. Another effective strategy for pest thrips are biological insecticides, including Beauveria bassiana or Verticillium lecanii. These demonstrate a clear effect on eggs, larvae and adults of thrips. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thripes occur when plants are illuminated with red light.',

Adult weevils are attracted to the surface between the piece and the stump. A minimum of three survey counts should be made at 2- to 3-day intervals to obtain reliable estimates. Adults should be removed each time. An average of 5 adults per trap is the action threshold for the split-log trap; an average of 15 to 20 adults is the threshold used with the stump trap.

Two trapping methods are used in Central and South America banana populations. The split-log trap uses fresh banana pseudostems cut into 1- to 1 1/2-foot lengths. The pseudostem logs are then split lengthwise through the center, and the halves are placed with the split surfaces on the soil at a number of locations in the field. The stump trap uses recently harvested plants. Trunks are cut about a foot from ground level. A piece of the remaining trunk is removed by making a second cut at a 30- to 45-degree angle about 6 inches from the ground. The resulting piece of trunk is placed back on the stump. Adult weevils are attracted to the surface between the piece and the stump. A minimum of three survey counts should be made at 2- to 3-day intervals to obtain reliable estimates. Adults should be removed each time. An average of 5 adults per trap is the action threshold for the split-log trap; an average of 15 to 20 adults is the threshold used with the stump trap. Insecticidal treatments are recommended when counts exceed the action threshold.',

When there are large populations, tunnels are found through most of the corm tissue and a short distance up the pseudostem. This tunnelling weakens the plant and renders it susceptible to "blowdown" in windy weather. Heavy infestations interfere with the movement of nutrients to the plant, and plants appear unthrifty. In severe cases the young suckers whither and fail to develop. This pest can become a major pest, reducing plant growth and causing extensive plant fall outs. Typical symptoms of a severe infestation are reduced plant growth, choking of the bunch in the pseudostem, yellow leaves and weak or dying suckers.',

The newly emerged pseudostem borer is reddish brown but soon becomes uniformly dull black. The pseudostem borers are nocturnal and hide during the day in or around corms or in moist areas near the plant and in the trash. Unusually sluggish in their movements, they feign death when disturbed and seldom fly. Natural spread is very slow. Dispersal is primarily by the introduction of infested suckers and bits for planting. Eggs are laid singly in a shallow pit at the base of the pseudostem. They are elongate, oval, about 2 mm long and pearly white. The eggs are very hard to find because the oviposition site becomes covered by congealed sap. The soft, creamy-white, stout (up to 10 mm in length), legless larvae have a distinctly curved body, are swollen in the middle and have a hard brown head. Pupae are about the same size as the larvae. Inside the white pupal skin the structure of the future adult with its snout, wing buds, legs and antennae is visible.',

          treatment: 'Cultural Control-The most practical method of combating O. longicollis consists of prevention by means of clean culture, accompanied by trapping the adults. Clean culture should include the removal of trash which provides hiding places and, more especially, the removal of broken and decaying plants which serve as breeding places. The practice of cutting off the stems at a height varying from 2 to 7 feet and allowing these to remain until they disintegrate provides ideal breeding conditions for the beetles. One of these cut stems may have dozens of insects in all stages of their development (Hoffmann, 1933). In Assam, northern India, Isahaque (1978) found that dead banana plants remained succulent for a long time and therefore permitted the survival of larvae and pupae during the winter. He recommended the removal and burning of dry leaves and leaf sheaths, and dead or cut pseudostems, in the winter to help reduce weevil populations. Trapping can be done by placing cut pieces of stem in the field for the purpose of attracting beetles for oviposition. These traps are best destroyed at regular intervals, of short enough duration to prevent maturity of any larvae which might hatch. The traps should be visited frequently and the adults destroyed. Either the weevils are crushed or the traps burnt to kill the weevils. If very thin slices of stem are used as traps, they will be insufficient to allow the complete development to take place; Biological Control-The technique of release of sterile males may have potential in control of this weevil (Chiang, 1965). One-day-old male pupae were irradiated with X-rays and gamma-rays. The maximum practical dose for use in studies on control by the release of sterile males was 2000 R. Inundative releases of sterile males into banana plantations were made to compete with fertile males so that the number of viable offspring would be reduced. Apparently this approach to weevil control was not followed up; Host-plant Resistance-In India, Isahaque (1978) showed that the banana variety Bhimkal was completely free of infestation by O. longicollis. In addition Kaskal was highly resistant and Jahajee was resistant. Resistance in these three varieties appeared to be connected with their broad, thick and compact leaf-sheaths and pseudostems, although chemical antibiosis may also have been a contributing factor; Chemical Control-In India infested pseudostems have been fumigated after the initiation of flowering, otherwise there was a phytotoxic effect. Three aluminium phosphide tablets per plant were inserted 15 cm above ground level, at a depth of a quarter of the pseudostem diameter. After insertion, the entry hole was sealed (Anon., 1977); Integrated Pest Management-Wijesekara and Menike (1991) stated that it is possible to manage O. longicollis and Cosmopolites by a combination of cultural and chemical control. All infested plants are removed, the pseudostems split open and allowed to dry in the field (if convenient all pseudostems are remoned from field and destroyed by feeding to cows or pigs). The pseudostems of harvested banana plants are cut at ground level and carbofuran [a hazardous pesticide that is now banned] granules applied onto the cut surface, which is covered with another piece of pseudostem to make a trap. Twenty five such pseudostem traps per acre are randomly placed at the base of clumps once a month. Uninfested planting material should always be used for establishing a new plantation.',

This devastating disease is caused by Pineapple mealybug wilt associated virus-2 (PMWaV-2), a mealybug-transmitted ampelovirus. There are two types of wilt, quick wilt and slow wilt. Quick wilt, also known as mealybug wilt, develops around 2 months after a short attack by a large colony of mealybugs, whereas slow wilt is caused by many mealybugs feeding on the plant tissue over many months. Slow wilt causes the inner leaves to turn dry and brown, and causes outer leaves to lose their turgidity and droop. Unlike slow wilt, quick wilt causes leaves to turn a yellow-pink colour. In plants younger than 6 months, quick wilt causes inner leaves to turn light green to pale yellow or pink. In older plants, quick wilt causes leaves to droop, turn pink and dry out. Both types of wilt cause leaves to droop and dry out. They also both affect the fruit yield of the plant, especially if symptoms are seen early in the season. ',

          treatment: 'Prevention - controlling mutualistic ants will prevent the build-up of mealybug populations, by reducing the protection the mealybugs benefit from and by allowing natural enemies to prey on any mealybugs present. Physical barriers such as ant fences have shown partial effectiveness, but the most effective ant control involves the use of insecticidal baits. A commonly used chemical for these baits is hydramethylnon; Control - although it is thought that the control of ants is an effective way to prevent the build-up of D. neobrevipes, the mealybugs themselves may also need controlling. Even if mealybugs have already established and symptoms of pineapple wilt have been observed, control should still be implemented as recovery can be rapid if the appropriate control measures are put in to place; Movement Control - controlling ants will prevent them from transporting mealybugs further in an area. The use of wind barriers around the edge of the field can reduce the number of mealybug crawlers (first instars) that are spread by the wind to uninfested areas; Biological Control - D. neobrevipes has a range of natural enemies that, in the absence of caretaker ants, can effectively control populations of the mealybug. New predators can be introduced to an area in order to control the mealybugs, but without first controlling ant populations, these introductions will not be effective; Chemical Control - chemicals can be effective at controlling D. neobrevipes, but if the mealybugs are feeding deep in the plant, they will be hidden from the application of insecticides. The waxy coating on the mealybugs may prevent penetration of chemical sprays, reducing their effectiveness. Insecticides that have been used in the control of mealybugs include the organophosphates malathion and diazinon.',

Biological control efforts were mostly stopped post-World War II with the development of broad-application insecticides. There are many more natural enemies of the pineapple mealybug for other crops where they are generally considered a minor pest. Biological control is much less effective when ants tend to the pest because the ants will actively defend the pineapple mealybug from harm. There are, so far, no good biological controls for ants tending pineapple mealybug, as the major predators of these ants are other ant species that drive the former out of the field. Mechanical/Physical/Cultural Control: Heat treating the pineapple crowns in a water bath at 50°C for 30 minutes rendered them free of Pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus and made the crowns less desirable for pineapple mealybug colonization. The most successful control of the pineapple mealybug thus far has been through control of the ant populations that tend to the pest. Without the care of ants, the pineapple mealybug becomes much more susceptible to predators and parasitoids, and the effectiveness of biological control increases. Ant bait traps and other ground traps have also been effective.',

          treatment: 'Management of scale and mealybug insects begins with detection and identification of the pest. Mealybugs can be very small or resemble disease organisms or even plant structures, making detection difficult. Regular monitoring will allow detection of these pests before damage is obvious and will also allow improved control. All plant parts need to be searched, including the undersides of leaves and stems. Inspection of plants prior to introducing them into the landscape, nursery or collection is very important in reducing new infestations of scales. Management can be difficult because of the waxy material mealybugs produce which provides protection from many insecticides. Pruning or washing infested plant parts can be helpful in reducing populations, particularly in cases of small infestations. A brisk wash spray of water can also be helpful in removing mealybugs from plants and reducing the population. Mealybugs are commonly attacked by predators, parasites and diseases which can help manage populations, particularly for long term control. It is important to recognize the presence of beneficial insects and to take steps to conserve them in the environment so they are available to control the pest insects. It is often necessary to manage mealybugs with insecticides so it is important to select appropriate insecticides, timing and application methods to reduce negative impact on the natural enemies but still get maximum control. Contact insecticides commonly provide quick knockdown of the pest but require good coverage and generally repeat applications. The stage most susceptible to contact insecticides is the crawler stage. Horticultural oil and insecticidal soaps also can provide good control, but must be treated like contact insecticides, which require thorough coverage and repeat applications. Systemic insecticides can provide excellent options for scale control and can provide some flexibility in application timing and methods. These insecticides move through the plant and provide an excellent way to expose scale insects to the insecticide when they feed on the plant. It is important not to overuse or misuse insecticides which can lead to numerous problems including insecticide resistance. To avoid insecticide resistance it is critical to rotate among insecticide groups.',

Organic pesticides, like insecticidal soap and d-Limonene can also be used to kill the larvae. However, these products have very little persistence in the environment, so several applications during egg-hatching will be required for effective control. Azamax contains azadirachtin, the key insecticidal ingredient found in neem oil. This concentrated spray is approved for organic use and offers multiple modes of action, making it virtually impossible for pest resistance to develop. Best of all, it’s non-toxic to honey bees and many other beneficial insects. Horticultural oils and other safe, oil-based insecticides work by smothering insects and will control all pest stages, including adults which are protected from most other insecticides by their armor coverings. Fast-acting botanical insecticides should be used as a last resort.
